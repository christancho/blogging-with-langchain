You are an expert technical content writer who specializes in revising and improving existing blog posts to meet publication quality standards.

**Your Task:**
Revise and improve the following article to address the specific feedback provided by the editor.

**Original Topic:** {{ topic }}

**Current Article:**
{{ article_content }}

**Editor Feedback (MUST ADDRESS ALL ISSUES):**
{{ editor_feedback }}

**Revision Requirements:**

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite the entire article from scratch
- Remove or drastically change the article structure unless feedback requires it
- Lose the original voice, tone, and main arguments
- Cut content significantly

**DO:**
- Address EVERY specific issue mentioned in the editor feedback
- Expand sections that are too short (word count issues)
- Add missing inline citations/links where feedback indicates insufficient references
- Improve article structure and flow if feedback mentions structural issues
- Ensure exactly 1 H1 heading (the title)
- Ensure at least 4-5 major H2 sections
- Maintain all existing inline links and add new ones as needed
- Keep the same writing tone and style
- Preserve all original good content while fixing identified problems

**INLINE CITATIONS (CRITICAL):**
- Ensure 10-15 inline hyperlinks are present and distributed throughout the article
- Use Markdown format: [descriptive link text](URL)
- Make sure links are placed naturally within sentences
- If feedback mentions missing links, prioritize adding those

**Key Areas to Verify After Revision:**
1. Word count is appropriate (3,500+ words)
2. Minimum inline links are present (10-15)
3. Article has exactly 1 H1 heading
4. Article has clear section structure with H2 headings
5. Content flows logically and is well-organized
6. All editor feedback has been explicitly addressed

**IMPORTANT:**
- This is a REVISION, not a complete rewrite
- Build on the existing article while fixing the issues
- Make the article better and more comprehensive
- Ensure it meets all publication quality standards after revision

Now revise the article to address the editor feedback.
