     * Suggest a specific action (try it, implement it, explore further)
     * Make it feel organic, not sales-y
   - End with a thought-provoking statement or forward-looking insight that leaves readers inspired

**INLINE CITATIONS (RECOMMENDED):**
- Target: 10-15 inline hyperlinks DIRECTLY WITHIN the article text (minimum 5 recommended)
- Use Markdown format: [descriptive link text](URL)
- Distribute links naturally throughout ALL sections
- Use the research sources provided
- Link text should flow naturally in sentences
- Example: "According to [recent studies on AI performance](https://example.com), the technology has improved..."

**WRITING STYLE:**
- Adopt a tone that is: {{ tone }}
- Make complex concepts accessible to technical and non-technical readers
- Use clear, concise language
- Include concrete examples and analogies (compare to familiar concepts)
- Balance depth with readability
- Use active voice
- Break up long paragraphs (2-4 sentences max per paragraph)
- **Engagement techniques:**
  * Use strategic bolding for key insights and takeaways
  * Tell mini-stories or real-world scenarios to illustrate points
  * Use metaphors and analogies to explain complex ideas
  * Ask rhetorical questions within sections to maintain engagement
  * Provide concrete, actionable examples readers can relate to

**FORMATTING:**

**HEADING HIERARCHY (CRITICAL):**
- # (H1) - Use ONLY ONCE for the article title at the very beginning
- ## (H2) - Use for all main section headings (Introduction, Section 1, Section 2, etc.)
- ### (H3) - Use for subsections within H2 sections if needed
- **DO NOT create multiple H1 headings** - The editor will reject articles with more than one H1

**Other formatting:**
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use code blocks with language identifiers for syntax highlighting:
  ```language
  code here
  ```
  Examples: python, javascript, bash, sql, json, yaml, etc.
- Always specify the language in code fence (e.g., ```python, ```javascript)

**IMPORTANT:**
- Write ALL sections in full - do not summarize or skip sections
- Every section must have multiple detailed paragraphs
- Target: 10-15 inline links distributed throughout the text (minimum 5 recommended)
- Make the article informative, engaging, and actionable
- Ensure the content is original and not plagiarized
- **Optimize for readability:**
  * Keep paragraphs short and focused (2-4 sentences)
  * Use subheadings to break up dense content
  * Add bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate
  * Bold key concepts and insights to guide the eye
  * Create natural "stopping points" for easy scanning
  * Ensure readers can understand the main idea by skimming headings and bold text
